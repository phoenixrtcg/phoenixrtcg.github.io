I am a computer engineering major at CSUF! If the Lord sees fit, I will graduate in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

==LAB 5== 

Lab 5, part 1 is a personal favorite of mine. It felt like the first lab where we truly got to see what programming can do. The ability to do simple math felt like it opened so many doors for our abilities and what future labs could be like.


==LAB 7==

Lab 7 was a doozy. The parking validation challenge felt like an insane crash course in combining if statements and booleans. I haven’t had that grand of a time doing that since I coded my game Somerset (available now - just ask!). Lab 7 was really when things got serious in my eyes.


==LAB 8==

Oh Lab 8. Where do I even begin?! Seeing the pattern we were expected to create come together so flawlessly was indescribably satisfying. I must say, I felt a surge of almost dark power coursing through my fingertips when me and my partner’s little experiment came together in a flurry of backslashes and asterisks.
